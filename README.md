<h1 align="center"><strong>Shopping List</strong> project</h1>

## Description

I just want to learn a few things about building REST API. I have decided to start with the backend part and later on I will figure out the frontend part. 
Let's see what has been done so far.

## Backend
### Technologies:
- **Framework:** Django
- **Language:** Python
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Serialization to:** JSON
- **Other**: Postman, pytest/pytest-django, venv

### Tests
All the test have been done using pytest/pytest-django. For more information go to `ShoppingList/tests.py` and `ShoppingList/conftest.py` or `Accounts/tests.py` and `Accounts/conftest.py`.
Additionally, manual tests were performed using Postman to validate various request types on different endpoints.


## Frontend
Once I learn either React, Angular or Vue I will start working on the Frontend part of the app.
